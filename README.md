## General Info

A bunch of my personal mods for Red Dead Redeption 2 made as .NET Class library project. It imports a .dll into "scripts" folder in your game root directory.  

## Release 1.0

First release here includes 3 mods which can be enabled as follows:

- F1 - "Teleporting Bow" mod that allows you to teleport to position you aiming at. Just press "T" on your keyboard using bow as a weapon. Note: position to teleport must be within 200 meters from Arthur.
- F2 - "Explosive Shotguns" mod while enabled makes all shots made with any shotgun explosive, i.e. every show will cause huge explosion on the impact position. Note: try not to shoot close to yourself, you know how explosion works ^^
- F3 - "Ped Spawn" mod gives you an ability to spawn every ped (human or animal) in the game. Just type ped name in the field and press Enter, and written ped will spawn immediately at the aiming position. Note: list of all peds' you can see here: https://www.mod-rdr.com/wiki/ped-search/
